# BachelorProject
This project will explore the oversquashing problem in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and how it affects the ability for the model to learn long-range dependencies between nodes.
The project will also explore the use of topological information in the form of the dataset's graph structure to improve the model's ability to learn long-range dependencies.
